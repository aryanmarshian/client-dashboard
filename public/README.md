Place your background image at public/bg.jpg so the app can load it at runtime.

Recommended sizes:

- Desktop: 1920x1080
- Mobile: 800x1200

Name the file exactly `bg.jpg` and place it in the project's `public/` folder.

If you prefer a different filename, update `src/index.css` background-image URL accordingly.
